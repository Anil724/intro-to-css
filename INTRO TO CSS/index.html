      While the MCU has pulled from the original comics in many regards, one key
      aspect of Captain America's leadership of the Avengers has been left out
      completely. A huge mark of Cap’s leadership includes the Star-Spangled
      Avenger using the team to redeem villains and turn them into heroes. The
      membership of the Avengers has been in flux since The Avengers #2 by Jack
      Kirby, Stan Lee, Paul Reinman, Stan Goldberg, and Artie Simek, when Hulk
      left the team after their first adventure. The next big shake-up occurred
      in The Avengers #16 by Kirby, Lee, Dick Ayers, Carl Hubbell, and Simek, in
      which the entire team (aside from Cap) takes a leave of absence following
      a harrowing battle with Baron Zemo’s Masters of Evil.As the years went on,
      more former villains like Black Widow and the Black Knight joined the
      ranks, as Captain America often recruited former foes into the Avengers.
      It may be hard to believe for modern fans, but staple members of the
      Avengers like Black Widow, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver all
      started out as villains in other books. Hawkeye and Black Widow were
      introduced as opponents for Iron Man, while Quicksilver and the Scarlet
      Witch were originally members of Magneto’s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in
      the pages of X-Men by Lee and Kirby.

      Casting Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was Marvel’s legit roll of the
      dice—and it changed stuff. Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige calls it the
      “biggest risk,” a move that could’ve sunk the MCU before it launched. In
      2008, Downey’s past struggles made him an unconventional choice. However,
      director Jon Favreau and Feige saw his charisma as perfect for Tony
      Stark’s genius and flaws. As Feige put it, “The risk was not casting him.”
      Now? It’s clear: Downey defined the MCU. PauseUnmute Fullscreen At the
      time, Marvel Studios wasn’t the entertainment powerhouse it is today. The
      studio was taking a chance on a lesser-known character to lead the way.
      Feige knew Iron Man had potential, but finding the right actor was
      crucial. Downey’s name was considered, and Favreau backed him as Stark
      from the get-go. Yet, it was a bold choice: Downey had never been an
      action star or a “marquee” headliner. But soon after casting him, they
      knew it was a win. Feige says, “Without Robert, we wouldn’t be sitting
      here today.”

      Hulk is one of the most popular Marvel characters, but how the character
      has been shown in the MCU makes it look debatable. People did not like it
      when the big green guy refused to come out in the time of need in
      Avengers: Infinity War. Its directors, Joe Russo, and Anthony Russo,
      popularly known as the Russo brothers, once revealed why Hulk might not
      have joined the fight against Thanos in the 2018 movie. Scroll below to
      know more. The movie featured an ensemble cast comprising the OG Avengers
      stars except for Jeremy Renner and several other actors who have appeared
      in multiple MCU movies. It was the first movie in the Infinity Saga’s
      finale films. People were disintegrated after Thanos’ snap. It is one of
      the highest-grossing movies of all time. It collected $2.05 billion in its
      worldwide run. Meanwhile, Mark Ruffalo has been playing the role of Hulk
      since 2012’s The Avengers. Previously, Edward Norton appeared in the role,
      but eventually, things did not work out, and Ruffalo replaced him.

      Firstly, it is worth exploring the elements of Agatha All Along that
      recontextualize Wanda’s villain story. Three years after WandaVision’s
      ending, the spin-off series is finally answering what happened to Wanda
      and Vision’s children: Billy and Tommy. Agatha All Along episode 6 took
      cues from Marvel Comics and told the story of William Kaplan, a young
      Jewish boy whose life changes forever when his body is inhabited by the
      soul of Billy Maximoff. It was revealed that, as Wanda’s Hex around the
      town of Westview was dissipating, William died in a car crash trying to
      return home to Eastview. The soul of Billy Maximoff, no longer kept alive
      by Wanda’s Hex, thus found a new vessel in the recently-deceased William.
      William was revived as Billy Maximoff, unaware of his prior life as either
      save for one name: Tommy. After uncovering his identity as the son of
      Wanda, Billy resolved to travel the MCU’s Witches’ Road in order to use
      the gifts promised at its end to find Tommy. Like Billy, Tommy’s soul
      found another vessel, but where remains to be seen.
